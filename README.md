This repo name was generated on Github and it is the best repo name ever! <-- personal opinion

# Onward to victory!

That said, this is a demonstration of how to configure a Jenkins server using Vagrant and Puppet for provisioning.

First, please use the latest version of [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). At the time of this writing I am using 2.1.1. I have not tried this with older versions of Vagrant, it might work or it might not.

Second, I am on macOs Sierra Version 10.12.6. Therefore my instructions will be tailored towards using a terminal in a \*nix environment.

Let's begin..

Open a terminal and navigate to where you would like a new directory to live. I personally keep all my repos and those I clone in a symlinked directory under my home directory called repos, very funny... I mean practical, I know but, I am not one to tell you how to organize your life/computer. Ok, time for some fun stuff!

Clone this repo:

...(or learn about cloning repos)[https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/]

git clone https://github.com/jlmoody/effective-goggles.git

Change directory:

cd effective-goggles

Do the thing:

vagrant up
